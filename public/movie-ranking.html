<h1>The Best movies according to Nick</h1>
<h2> My 3 best movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the rings</h3>
<p>It is a trilogy which i could easily use each part for each movie, but I will refrain from doing so </p>
<h3>Harry potter</h3>
<p>Mainly because my wife like this movie series and I find them appealing to some extent</p>
<h3>Princess Bride</h3>
<p>Because why not?</p>
